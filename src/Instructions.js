        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>The app is a pretty close copy of Canvas but I don't know where they got some of their assets</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>The database to keep the data is just the LocalStorage just to keep it simple</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>Sadly the 3 day window of the application is an unfortunate time for me</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>So I didn't have as much time to do other stuff just to look pretty like the menu and the side-nav but oh well</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>Could have made it responsive too but thats just @media and conditions so not the biggest deal</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>The top bar is just for aesthetics when it comes to the availability stuff</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>The reset clears everything like the attempts and if a quiz is currently ongoing</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>Note that there are only 10 questions but some have 2 point values</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>Hopefully everything works fine and it is downloaded with no issue, just drop a msg</h3>
        <h3 className='instruction-font' style={{marginBottom:"1rem"}}>To juan_miguel_miranda@dlsu.edu.ph if it is being cringe, many thankz :^)</h3>
